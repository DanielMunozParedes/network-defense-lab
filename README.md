# Network Defense & Detection Lab

This project simulates real-world network-based attacks within a self-hosted lab environment and implements defensive monitoring and detection logic to identify, analyze, and document malicious activity.

It is part of a broader cybersecurity portfolio focused on developing practical, hands-on skills in detection engineering, log analysis, and system monitoring.

---

## Objectives

- Simulate common network threats (port scans, brute-force attempts, unauthorized connections)
- Monitor network activity and system logs
- Detect threats using log-based analysis and detection rules
- Document attack scenarios and incident responses
- Automate aspects of log filtering and detection logic

## Lab Architecture

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Kali Linux | Simulates attacker activity (Nmap, Hydra, Netcat) |
| Ubuntu Server | Target system for logging and detection |
| Wazuh (optional) | SIEM/log management and alert generation |
| Tools | UFW, syslog, tcpdump, Wireshark, Python, Bash |
